This repo is for using Lucid_HSI_camera from robotnation

1. environment setup
    download docker can have all you needed
    $cd ~/lucid_hsi_camera
    $source Docker/docker_run.sh
    
2.network setup(out of docker)
    $sudo nmtui
    Edit a connection -> change IPV4 IPV6 from DHCP to Link-Local
    
3.How to run?(In ubuntu18.04 docker)
  (1)with jupyter-notebook
    $source colab_jupyter.sh
    goto: http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=assistive
    
    In folder lucid_HSI_camera/HSI_camera you can find notebook of using hsi_camera
    *warning: using notebook will slow down the scanning speed run as script will be faster
  
  (2)run with ros
    $cd lucid_HSI_camera
    $source environment.sh
    $source set_ros_ip [$your machine ip]
    $source set_ros_master [$your ros master ip]
    $roslaunch hsi_scanner scan.launch
    (topic /start_scan(type: std_msgs/Bool) if get true, start to scan)
    (topic /scan_reslt(type: std_msgs/String) will return the dominate band of spectrum)
    
    (parameter of scan.launch)
    level: the scan level 2:RGB scan 4:radiance (default is '2')  *using level6 of reflectance need change .json file and calibration file
    exp: the exposure time of scan (default is '10' ms)
    nlines: How many times to scan for a result (default is '100')
    save_flag: To save the scan result or not (default is 'False')
    scan_name: the save file name of scan (default is "test")

3.For 6SV model(for using level6 setting)
    extract 6SV-1.1.tar on machine
    (In docker)you need compile the code on your machine 
    $cd /home/arghsi/lucid_HSI_camera/6SV-1.1/6SV1.1
    $make
    
    How to test it works
    $cd /home/arghsi/lucid_HSI_camera/6SV-1.1/6SV1.1
    $./sixsV1.1 < ../Examples/Example_In_1.txt 

4.For using level 6 scanning(now only run in notebook)
  (1)update calibration file
    run notebook 09 (it takes time to update calibration file)
  (2)scan with level 6
    run notebook 03 and change the json_path and pkl_path to file name ..._fix.json ..._fix.pkl
    change processing_lvl to 6

5.change datacube(scan_result) level
